A linked list is built in this lab. Make sure to keep track of the head node.

(1) Define the class ContactNode per the following specifications:
    Private data members
    string contactName
    string contactPhoneNumber
    ContactNode* nextNodePtr
    Constructor with parameters for name followed by phone number (1 pt)
    Public member functions
    GetName() - Accessor (1 pt)
    GetPhoneNumber() - Accessor (1 pt)
    InsertAfter() (2 pts)
    GetNext() - Accessor (1 pt)
    PrintContactNode()
    Ex: If the name is Roxanne Hughes and the phone number is 443-555-2864, PrintContactNode() outputs:
*/

/*
    (2) Define main() to read the name and phone number for three contacts and output each contact. Create three ContactNodes and use the nodes to build a linked list. (2 pts)

/*
    (3) Output the linked list using a loop to output contacts one at a time. (2 pts)
